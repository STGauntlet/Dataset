# Data set
The data set consists of the training set and test set. The training set contains Lie algebra-based motion features collected from six participants (P1-P6). The test set is collected from 3 testers (T1-T3) and is used to verify the performance of our framework.

The Lie algebra-based motion features was calculated by motion sensor data collected from a wearable glove at a sampling rate of 25Hz (file: Train_Lie algebra.csv, Test_Lie algebra.csv).  The file contains 43 columns:
